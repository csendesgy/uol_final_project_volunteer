# uol_final_project_volunteer
University of London final project for nonprofit volunteer website for AWD template.

The goal is to create a website that can help volunteers browse multiple organizations' opportunities in a single site.
This can help increase the number of volunteers and the events they participate as it simplifies the process of finding and applying for such opportunities.
